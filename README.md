Positive plant interactions and niche expansion in deserts.
A systematic review and ontology of niche theory and positive interaction empirical studies in deserts.

We reviewed the capacity for positive plant interactions to expand the niche of subdominant species. We synthesized the available literature using a formalized systematic review by using the Web of Science and associated terms with niche, positive interactions in plants such as facilitation, and deserts. As a proof of concept, primary studies were included that reported net increases in the extent of niche expansion due to positive plant interactions.
